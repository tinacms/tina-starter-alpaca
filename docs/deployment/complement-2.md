The term **bristlecone pine** covers three [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") of [pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine "Pine") tree (family [Pinaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinaceae "Pinaceae"), genus [_Pinus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus "Pinus"), subsection _Balfourianae_). All three species are long-lived and highly resilient to harsh weather and bad soils. One of the three species, _Pinus longaeva_, is among the longest-lived life forms on Earth. The oldest _Pinus longaeva_ is more than 5,000 years old,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-oldest-1) making it the oldest known individual of any species.
